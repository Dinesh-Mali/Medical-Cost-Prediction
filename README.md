# Medical-Cost-Prediction
In this App, we have predicted the medical cost of person based on its personal traits and location using machine learning.

# Introduction
We have a dataset that contains information about people who had to pay for medical or surgeries. It states out some of the characteristics of these
people, like their sex, smoker or non-smoker, etc. 

We will be using this data to predict the cost of medical assistance a person has to pay.

# Project Flow

1) Building a machine learning model to predict if a site is a phishing site ot not.

2) We build a web app on Django to mount the prediction model.

3) We deploy the Django project on Heroku through github
